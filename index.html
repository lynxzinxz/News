                    <p>With the recent news about the diarrhea outbreak in Baguio City, the public has started to be concerned about their health and safety.
                        The cases started going up on December 21, and in just 18 days, there were 308 people with diarrhea.
                         <br><br>
                        The water sources in Baguio City are being tested by the Department of Health (DOH) to determine what’s caused them to have diarrhea. 
                        That’s why it is a good idea that the government knows how to act when people’s health is at risk.
                         <br><br>
                        In this case, I realized how important it is to know that our water source is free from any disease that might affect the entire community. Water plays such an important role in our lives that we need to ensure its safety.</p>
